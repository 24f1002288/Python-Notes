# Python Programming Concepts Overview

This document summarizes key concepts in Python programming, covering foundational elements and more advanced topics. Python treats every entity as an object, which is a fundamental principle throughout the language.

## 1. Data Types and Variables

### Understanding Data Types

In Python, every piece of data is an object. There are five main categories of built-in data types, each with its own characteristics:

*   **Numeric Types:** Used for numbers.
    *   `int`: Whole numbers (e.g., `10`, `-5`).
    *   `float`: Decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.5`).
    *   `complex`: Numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g., `2 + 3j`).
*   **Sequence Types:** Ordered collections of items.
    *   `str`: Immutable sequences of characters (text, e.g., `"hello"`).
    *   `list`: Mutable (changeable) ordered sequences of items (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
    *   `tuple`: Immutable (unchangeable) ordered sequences of items (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`).
*   **Dictionary Type (`dict`):** Unordered collections of key-value pairs (e.g., `{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}`). Keys must be unique and immutable.
*   **Set Type (`set`):** Unordered collections of unique items (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`).
*   **Boolean Type (`bool`):** Represents truth values, either `True` or `False`.

**How Data Types are Created (Constructors):**
Each data type has a specific way of being created. Often, this involves literal notation (like `10` for an integer or `"hello"` for a string) or using a "constructor" which is essentially a function that creates an object of that type (e.g., `list()`, `int()`).

**Code Example - Data Type Creation:**

```python
# Numeric
my_integer = 10
my_float = 3.14
my_complex = 2 + 3j
print(f"Integer: {my_integer}, Type: {type(my_integer)}")
print(f"Float: {my_float}, Type: {type(my_float)}")
print(f"Complex: {my_complex}, Type: {type(my_complex)}")

# Sequence
my_string = "Hello Python"
my_list = [1, "two", 3.0]
my_tuple = (4, 5, "six")
print(f"String: {my_string}, Type: {type(my_string)}")
print(f"List: {my_list}, Type: {type(my_list)}")
print(f"Tuple: {my_tuple}, Type: {type(my_tuple)}")

# Dictionary
my_dictionary = {"apple": 1, "banana": 2}
print(f"Dictionary: {my_dictionary}, Type: {type(my_dictionary)}")

# Set
my_set = {10, 20, 30}
print(f"Set: {my_set}, Type: {type(my_set)}")

# Boolean
is_active = True
print(f"Boolean: {is_active}, Type: {type(is_active)}")
```
**Explanation:** The `type()` function is used to check the data type of a variable. Each variable is assigned a value using various literal syntaxes which implicitly call the respective type's constructor.

### Working with Variables

Variables are names used to store data.

*   **No Pre-Declaration:** Unlike some other languages, you don't need to declare a variable's type before using it. A variable is automatically initialized when you assign a value to it.
*   **Dynamic Typing:** Python supports dynamic typing, meaning a variable's data type can change during program execution. You can store an integer in a variable, and later assign a string to the *same* variable.

**Code Example - Variable Initialization and Dynamic Typing:**

```python
# Initializing with an integer
my_variable = 10
print(f"Value: {my_variable}, Type: {type(my_variable)}")

# Dynamic typing: assigning a string to the same variable
my_variable = "Python rocks!"
print(f"Value: {my_variable}, Type: {type(my_variable)}")
```
**Explanation:** Initially, `my_variable` holds an integer. Then, the same variable is reassigned to hold a string, demonstrating Python's dynamic typing where the variable's type adapts to the value it currently holds.

*   **Variable Naming Rules:**
    *   Can contain letters (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9), and the underscore (`_`).
    *   Cannot start with a number.
    *   Case-sensitive (e.g., `myVar` is different from `myvar`).

**Code Example - Variable Naming:**

```python
# Valid variable names
my_age = 30
name2 = "Bob"
_total_count = 100

# Invalid variable names (would cause an error if uncommented)
# 2names = "Alice" # Cannot start with a number
# my-variable = 50 # Hyphens are not allowed

# Case sensitivity
score = 10
Score = 20
print(f"score: {score}, Score: {Score}") # They are treated as different variables
```
**Explanation:** Valid names follow the rules. `2names` is invalid because it starts with a digit. `my-variable` is invalid because hyphens are not allowed. `score` and `Score` are distinct variables due to case sensitivity.

---

## 2. Operators

Operators are special symbols that perform operations on values and variables. There are five main categories:

*   **Arithmetic Operators:** For mathematical calculations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` modulus, `**` exponentiation, `//` floor division).
*   **Comparison Operators:** Used to compare values and return a Boolean result (`==` equal, `!=` not equal, `>` greater than, `<` less than, `>=` greater than or equal, `<=` less than or equal). Often used in conditional statements.
*   **Logical Operators:** Used to combine conditional statements (`and`, `or`, `not`).
*   **Membership Operators:** Used with data structures to check if an element is present (`in`, `not in`).
*   **Identity Operators:** Used to check if two variables refer to the same object in memory (`is`, `is not`).

**Code Example - Operators:**

```python
x = 10
y = 3

# Arithmetic Operators
print(f"Arithmetic: x + y = {x + y}")  # Addition
print(f"Arithmetic: x / y = {x / y}")  # Division
print(f"Arithmetic: x % y = {x % y}")  # Modulus (remainder)

# Comparison Operators
print(f"Comparison: x == y is {x == y}")  # Equal to
print(f"Comparison: x > y is {x > y}")    # Greater than

# Logical Operators
a = True
b = False
print(f"Logical: a and b is {a and b}")
print(f"Logical: a or b is {a or b}")
print(f"Logical: not a is {not a}")

# Membership Operators
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(f"Membership: 3 in my_list is {3 in my_list}")
print(f"Membership: 5 not in my_list is {5 not in my_list}")

# Identity Operators
list1 = [1, 2]
list2 = [1, 2]
list3 = list1
print(f"Identity: list1 is list2 is {list1 is list2}") # False, different objects in memory
print(f"Identity: list1 is list3 is {list1 is list3}") # True, both refer to the same object
```
**Explanation:** Each operator category is demonstrated with simple examples, showing the operations they perform and the resulting values. Pay close attention to the difference between `==` (value equality) and `is` (identity/same object in memory).

---

## 3. Formatted Printing

Controlling how output appears on the console is important. Python offers powerful ways to format strings.

*   **f-strings (Formatted String Literals):** A concise way to embed expressions inside string literals. Prefix the string with `f` or `F`.
*   **`str.format()` Method:** Another flexible method for formatting strings. Place placeholders (`{}`) in the string and call `.format()` with the values.
*   **Escape Characters:** Special characters used within strings to represent non-printable characters or to include special symbols that would otherwise terminate the string.
    *   `\n`: Newline
    *   `\t`: Tab
    *   `\\`: Backslash
    *   `\'`: Single quote
    *   `\"`: Double quote

**Code Example - Formatted Printing:**

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
pi_value = 3.14159

# Using f-strings
print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
print(f"Pi to 2 decimal places: {pi_value:.2f}") # Formatting float

# Using .format() method
print("Hello, {}! You are {} years old.".format(name, age))
print("Pi to 3 decimal places: {:.3f}".format(pi_value)) # Formatting float

# Using escape characters
print("This is line 1.\nThis is line 2 (newline).")
print("Item 1\tItem 2 (tab separated).")
print("He said, \"Hello!\"") # Using double quotes inside a double-quoted string
print('It\'s a beautiful day.') # Using single quote inside a single-quoted string
```
**Explanation:** `f-strings` and `str.format()` provide ways to dynamically insert variables and format their appearance within strings. Escape characters allow embedding special characters like newlines (`\n`) and tabs (`\t`) directly into string literals.

---

## 4. Libraries and Modules

Libraries (also called modules or packages) are collections of pre-written code that provide functions, classes, and variables to extend Python's capabilities.

*   **Importance:** They allow you to reuse code, perform complex tasks easily, and build powerful applications without writing everything from scratch.
*   **Ways to Import Libraries:** There are several ways to bring library content into your program:
    1.  `import library_name`: Imports the entire library. You must use `library_name.item` to access its contents.
    2.  `from library_name import *`: Imports all contents of the library directly into your current namespace. You can use `item` directly without the `library_name.` prefix. This can lead to name conflicts.
    3.  `from library_name import specific_item`: Imports only a specific function, class, or variable from the library. You can use `specific_item` directly.
    4.  `import library_name as alias`: Imports the entire library but gives it a shorter alias. You use `alias.item` to access its contents.
    5.  `from library_name import specific_item as alias`: Imports a specific item and gives it an alias. You use `alias` directly.

**Code Example - Importing Libraries:**

```python
# Create a dummy module for demonstration
# In a real scenario, this would be a separate .py file
# e.g., my_module.py containing:
# PI = 3.14159
# def greet(name):
#     return f"Hello, {name} from my_module!"
#
# For this example, let's pretend it exists.

# Example 1: Import the entire module
import math # A built-in Python module
print(f"Using 'import math': PI = {math.pi}")

# Example 2: Import all contents (generally discouraged due to potential name conflicts)
from math import * # Imports everything from math
print(f"Using 'from math import *': sin(0) = {sin(0)}") # sin is now directly available

# Example 3: Import specific items
from math import cos
print(f"Using 'from math import cos': cos(0) = {cos(0)}")

# Example 4: Import with an alias
import random as rnd
print(f"Using 'import random as rnd': Random number = {rnd.randint(1, 10)}")

# Example 5: Import specific item with an alias
from math import exp as exponential
print(f"Using 'from math import exp as exponential': e^1 = {exponential(1)}")
```
**Explanation:** The `math` module (a standard Python library) is used to illustrate different import syntaxes. Each method changes how you reference the functions or variables within that module. Using aliases is common for convenience, especially with longer module names.

*   **External Libraries:**
    *   Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    *   NumPy: For numerical computing, especially with arrays.
    *   Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
    These are external libraries, meaning they are not part of Python's standard installation and often need to be installed separately. They have extensive online documentation.

---

## 5. Control Flow

Control flow statements determine the order in which instructions are executed in a program.

### Conditional Statements (`if-elif-else`)

Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions based on certain conditions.

*   **`if` block:** Executes a block of code if a condition is `True`.
*   **`elif` (else if) block:** Checks an alternative condition if the preceding `if` or `elif` conditions were `False`.
*   **`else` block:** Executes if all preceding `if` and `elif` conditions were `False`.
*   **Inline `if-else` (Ternary Operator):** A concise way to write simple `if-else` statements in a single line. It improves readability for short conditions but doesn't change execution efficiency.
    *   Syntax: `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`
*   **Nesting:** You can place `if-else` blocks inside other `if-else` blocks to handle more complex decision logic.

**Code Example - Conditional Statements:**

```python
score = 85

# Basic if-elif-else
if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
else:
    grade = "C"
print(f"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}")

# Inline if-else (Ternary Operator)
status = "Pass" if score >= 60 else "Fail"
print(f"Status: {status}")

# Nested if-else
age = 17
has_license = False

if age >= 18:
    if has_license:
        print("You can drive.")
    else:
        print("You are old enough, but need a license.")
else:
    print("You are too young to drive.")
```
**Explanation:** The first example shows a standard `if-elif-else` chain. The second demonstrates the concise inline `if-else` (ternary operator). The third example illustrates nested `if-else` structures for handling multiple conditions sequentially.

### Loops (`while` and `for`)

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

*   **`while` loop:** Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is `True`. You must ensure the condition eventually becomes `False` to avoid infinite loops.
*   **`for` loop:** Iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).
    *   **Using `range()` function:** Iterates a specific number of times. `range()` generates a sequence of numbers.
    *   **Without `range()` (for-each style):** Directly iterates over items in a collection.

**Code Example - Loops:**

```python
# while loop
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(f"While loop iteration: {count}")
    count += 1

# for loop with range()
print("\nFor loop using range(3):")
for i in range(3): # Generates numbers 0, 1, 2
    print(f"For loop with range: {i}")

# for loop without range (for-each style)
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("\nFor loop over a list:")
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"Current fruit: {fruit}")

# Nested loops
print("\nNested loops:")
for i in range(2):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"Outer: {i}, Inner: {j}")
```
**Explanation:** A `while` loop continues as long as its condition is met. A `for` loop can iterate a fixed number of times using `range()` or can directly iterate over items in a collection. Nested loops demonstrate how one loop can be contained within another.

*   **Loop Control Statements:**
    *   `break`: Immediately terminates the loop, exiting to the code after the loop.
    *   `continue`: Skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
    *   `pass`: A null operation; it does nothing. Used as a placeholder where syntax requires a statement but no action is desired (e.g., in an empty loop body or function definition).

**Code Example - Loop Control Statements:**

```python
# break
print("\nBreak statement:")
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break # Exit loop when i is 3
    print(f"Number (break): {i}")

# continue
print("\nContinue statement:")
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue # Skip printing when i is 2
    print(f"Number (continue): {i}")

# pass
print("\nPass statement:")
for i in range(3):
    if i == 1:
        pass # Do nothing when i is 1
    print(f"Number (pass): {i}")

def empty_function():
    pass # Placeholder for future code
```
**Explanation:** `break` halts the loop entirely. `continue` skips only the current iteration. `pass` acts as a placeholder; the loop continues normally, and the `pass` statement itself performs no action.

*   **`range()` Function Details:**
    *   `range(stop)`: Generates numbers from `0` up to (but not including) `stop`.
        *   `stop`: **Mandatory**. The upper limit (non-inclusive).
    *   `range(start, stop)`: Generates numbers from `start` up to (but not including) `stop`.
        *   `start`: **Optional**. Default value is `0`.
    *   `range(start, stop, step)`: Generates numbers from `start` up to (but not including) `stop`, incrementing by `step`.
        *   `step`: **Optional**. Default value is `1`. Can be negative for a decreasing sequence.

**Code Example - `range()` Function:**

```python
print("range(5):", list(range(5)))         # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
print("range(2, 7):", list(range(2, 7)))   # [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print("range(1, 10, 2):", list(range(1, 10, 2))) # [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print("range(10, 0, -1):", list(range(10, 0, -1))) # [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
**Explanation:** `range()` is crucial for controlling loop iterations. It generates a sequence of numbers (not a list itself, but an iterable that can be converted to a list) based on its `start`, `stop`, and `step` arguments. The `stop` value is always exclusive.

## 6. Functions

Functions are blocks of organized, reusable code that perform a single, related action.

### Built-in Functions

Python provides many useful functions that are readily available.

*   `print()`: Displays output on the console.
*   `input()`: Accepts user input from the console.
*   `type()`: Returns the type of an object.
*   `len()`: Returns the length (number of items) of an object (e.g., string, list, tuple).
*   `max()`: Returns the largest item in an iterable.
*   `min()`: Returns the smallest item in an iterable.
*   `sum()`: Returns the sum of all elements in an iterable of numbers.
*   `sorted()`: Returns a new sorted list from the items in an iterable.
*   `iter()`: Returns an iterator object.
*   `next()`: Retrieves the next item from an iterator.
*   `enumerate()`: Returns an enumerate object, yielding pairs of (index, item) from an iterable.
*   `zip()`: Combines multiple iterables into an iterator of tuples.
*   `map(function, iterable)`: Applies a given function to each item of an iterable and returns an iterator of the results.
*   `filter(function, iterable)`: Constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns `True`.

**Code Example - Built-in Functions:**

```python
# Basic I/O
# name = input("Enter your name: ") # Uncomment to test input
# print(f"Hello, {name}!")

my_list = [5, 2, 8, 1]
my_string = "Python"

print(f"Type of my_list: {type(my_list)}")
print(f"Length of my_string: {len(my_string)}")
print(f"Max in my_list: {max(my_list)}")
print(f"Min in my_list: {min(my_list)}")
print(f"Sum of my_list: {sum(my_list)}")
print(f"Sorted my_list: {sorted(my_list)}")

# enumerate
for index, value in enumerate(my_list):
    print(f"Index {index}: Value {value}")

# zip
names = ["Alice", "Bob"]
ages = [25, 30]
for name, age in zip(names, ages):
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")

# map
def square(x):
    return x * x
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
squared_numbers = list(map(square, numbers))
print(f"Squared numbers (map): {squared_numbers}")

# filter
def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0
filtered_numbers = list(filter(is_even, my_list))
print(f"Even numbers (filter): {filtered_numbers}")
```
**Explanation:** This covers common built-in functions for checking types, getting lengths, finding min/max/sum, sorting, and iterating with `enumerate`, `zip`, `map`, and `filter`. `map` and `filter` are powerful for functional programming styles.

### User-Defined Functions

You can create your own functions to organize your code and make it reusable.

*   **Definition:** Use the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses for parameters, and a colon. The function body is indented.
*   **Calling:** Use the function name followed by parentheses containing the arguments.
*   **Return Values:** Functions can return values using the `return` statement.

**Code Example - User-Defined Functions:**

```python
# Defining a simple function
def greet_user(name):
    """This function greets the user by name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling the function
message = greet_user("Charlie")
print(message)
```
**Explanation:** The `greet_user` function takes a `name` parameter and returns a greeting string. The `docstring` (triple-quoted string) explains the function's purpose.

*   **Types of Arguments:**
    1.  **Positional Arguments:** Arguments are passed to parameters in the order they are defined. Their position matters.
    2.  **Keyword Arguments:** Arguments are passed by explicitly naming the parameter. Their order does not matter.
    3.  **Default Arguments:** Parameters can have a default value. If a value is provided during the function call, it overrides the default; otherwise, the default is used.
        *   **Constraint:** Default arguments must always be placed at the end of the parameter list after any non-default (positional) arguments.

**Code Example - Function Arguments:**

```python
def describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name="Buddy"):
    """Describes a pet with its type and name."""
    return f"I have a {animal_type} named {pet_name}."

# Positional arguments
print(describe_pet("dog", "Max"))

# Keyword arguments (order doesn't matter)
print(describe_pet(pet_name="Whiskers", animal_type="cat"))

# Default argument usage
print(describe_pet("bird")) # Uses default pet_name "Buddy"
print(describe_pet("fish", "Nemo")) # Overrides default pet_name
```
**Explanation:** `describe_pet` uses both positional (`animal_type`) and a default argument (`pet_name`). The examples show how to call the function using strict positional order, using keyword arguments (where order doesn't matter), and utilizing the default value.

---

## 7. Collections (Data Structures)

Python offers powerful built-in data structures to store and organize collections of data. The four main types are:

*   **List:** Mutable, ordered, allows duplicate elements. `[item1, item2]`
*   **Tuple:** Immutable, ordered, allows duplicate elements. `(item1, item2)`
*   **Dictionary:** Mutable, unordered (in Python 3.7+ insertion order is preserved), stores key-value pairs, keys must be unique and immutable. `{key1: value1, key2: value2}`
*   **Set:** Mutable, unordered, stores unique elements. `{item1, item2}`

(A detailed comparison table would typically be provided in the course material, highlighting mutability, ordering, and uniqueness for each.)

**Code Example - Collections:**

```python
# List
my_list = [10, 20, "hello", 20]
print(f"List: {my_list}")
my_list.append(30) # Mutable
print(f"List after append: {my_list}")

# Tuple
my_tuple = (10, "world", 20)
print(f"Tuple: {my_tuple}")
# my_tuple.append(30) # This would cause an error (immutable)

# Dictionary
my_dict = {"name": "Eve", "age": 28}
print(f"Dictionary: {my_dict}")
my_dict["city"] = "New York" # Mutable
print(f"Dictionary after adding item: {my_dict}")
print(f"Accessing dict value: {my_dict['name']}")

# Set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1} # Duplicates are automatically removed
print(f"Set: {my_set}")
my_set.add(4) # Mutable
print(f"Set after adding item: {my_set}")
```
**Explanation:** Each collection type is demonstrated with its typical creation syntax and a basic operation (append for list, add for set, adding a key-value pair for dictionary) to highlight their mutability and behavior regarding duplicates and order.

## 8. Advanced Concepts

These topics build upon the core concepts and enable more sophisticated programming techniques.

### Recursive Functions

A function that calls itself within its own definition.

*   **How it works:** A recursive function breaks down a problem into smaller, similar sub-problems. It keeps calling itself until it reaches a "base case" that can be solved directly, then it combines the results.
*   **Pain Point:** Without a proper base case, a recursive function can lead to an infinite loop (recursion depth error).

**Code Example - Recursive Function (Factorial):**

```python
def factorial(n):
    """Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion."""
    if n == 0: # Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
        return 1
    else: # Recursive step
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(f"Factorial of 5: {factorial(5)}") # 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
```
**Explanation:** The `factorial` function demonstrates recursion. It has a base case (`n == 0`) to stop the recursion and a recursive step (`n * factorial(n - 1)`) that calls itself with a smaller argument until the base case is reached.

### Lambda Functions

Also known as anonymous functions (functions without a name).

*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Can take any number of arguments.
    *   Can only have one expression.
    *   Often used for short, simple operations where a full `def` function is overkill, especially with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, or `sorted()`.

**Code Example - Lambda Function:**

```python
# A lambda function to add two numbers
add_two_numbers = lambda x, y: x + y
print(f"Lambda addition: {add_two_numbers(5, 3)}")

# Using lambda with map to square numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared_numbers_lambda = list(map(lambda num: num * num, numbers))
print(f"Squared numbers (lambda with map): {squared_numbers_lambda}")
```
**Explanation:** The first example defines a simple lambda function that adds two numbers. The second shows a common use case: passing a lambda function as an argument to `map()` to perform an operation on each element of a list concisely.

### List Comprehension

A concise and efficient way to create lists.

*   **Benefit:** Allows you to create new lists from existing iterables in a single line of code, often involving iteration and conditional logic. This is generally more "Pythonic" and often faster than traditional loops for list creation.

**Code Example - List Comprehension:**

```python
# Create a list of squares for numbers 0-4
squares = [x * x for x in range(5)]
print(f"Squares: {squares}")

# Create a list of even numbers from 0-9
even_numbers = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(f"Even numbers: {even_numbers}")
```
**Explanation:** The first example creates a list of squares. The second example creates a list of even numbers, demonstrating how conditional logic (`if x % 2 == 0`) can be integrated into list comprehensions.

### Exception Handling

A mechanism to deal with errors that occur during the execution of a program (runtime errors), which are different from syntax errors (errors in code structure).

*   **`try-except` blocks:**
    *   The `try` block contains code that might raise an exception.
    *   The `except` block catches specific exceptions and executes code to handle them.
*   **Built-in Exceptions:** Python has a wide range of predefined exception types (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `ZeroDivisionError`). It's good practice to catch specific exceptions rather than a general `Exception`. (Refer to Python documentation for a comprehensive list).
*   **`finally` block:** This block always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred in the `try` block or not. It's ideal for cleanup operations, such as closing files or deallocating resources, ensuring they are always performed.

**Code Example - Exception Handling:**

```python
# Basic try-except
try:
    result = 10 / 0 # This will cause a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!")
except TypeError:
    print("Error: Type mismatch!")
except Exception as e: # Catch any other unexpected error
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
print("Program continues after division attempt.")

# try-except-finally
file_path = "non_existent_file.txt"
try:
    f = open(file_path, "r")
    print(f.read())
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: The file '{file_path}' was not found.")
finally:
    # This block always runs, regardless of success or failure
    # Good practice to close resources if they were opened
    # A check is usually needed to ensure f exists and is open
    # For file handling, 'with' statement is often preferred.
    print("Finally block executed. Attempting cleanup.")
```
**Explanation:** The first example shows how `try` and `except` work to gracefully handle a `ZeroDivisionError`. You can have multiple `except` blocks for different error types. The second example demonstrates `finally`, which ensures a piece of code runs every time, typically for resource cleanup.

### File Handling

Allows your programs to interact with files stored on the computer, enabling reading from and writing to them.

*   **`open()` function:** Used to open or create a file.
    *   **Parameters:**
        1.  `filename`: The path to the file.
        2.  `mode`: Specifies how the file should be opened:
            *   `"r"`: Read (default). Error if file doesn't exist.
            *   `"w"`: Write. Creates file if it doesn't exist, *overwrites* if it does.
            *   `"a"`: Append. Creates file if it doesn't exist, adds to the end if it does.
            *   `"x"`: Create. Creates file, errors if it already exists.
    *   **File Type (appended to mode):**
        *   `"t"`: Text mode (default).
        *   `"b"`: Binary mode (e.g., for images, executables).
*   **Reading Functions:**
    *   `read()`: Reads the entire file content as a single string.
    *   `readline()`: Reads one line at a time.
    *   `readlines()`: Reads all lines into a list of strings.
*   **Writing Function:**
    *   `write()`: Writes a string to the file.

**Code Example - File Handling:**

```python
# Writing to a file
try:
    with open("my_notes.txt", "w") as file:
        file.write("This is the first line.\n")
        file.write("This is the second line.\n")
    print("Content written to 'my_notes.txt'.")
except IOError as e:
    print(f"Error writing file: {e}")

# Reading from a file
try:
    with open("my_notes.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
        print("\n--- File Content (read()) ---")
        print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File 'my_notes.txt' not found for reading.")

# Reading line by line
try:
    with open("my_notes.txt", "r") as file:
        print("\n--- File Content (readline()) ---")
        line1 = file.readline()
        line2 = file.readline()
        print(f"Line 1: {line1.strip()}") # .strip() removes trailing newline
        print(f"Line 2: {line2.strip()}")
except FileNotFoundError:
    pass # Already handled, or can add a new message
```
**Explanation:** The `with open(...) as file:` syntax is the preferred way to handle files, as it ensures the file is automatically closed even if errors occur. Examples demonstrate writing content and reading it back using `read()` and `readline()`.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

A programming paradigm that models real-world entities as "objects" with properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

*   **Classes:** Blueprints for creating objects. Defined using the `class` keyword.
*   **Objects:** Instances of a class. Created by calling the class name as a function (its constructor).
*   **Attributes:** Variables defined within a class that belong to an object. They represent the data or properties of an object.
*   **Methods:** Functions defined within a class that operate on the object's attributes. They represent the behaviors of an object.
*   **`__init__` method (Constructor):** A special method that is automatically called when a new object is created. It's used to initialize the object's attributes. The `self` parameter refers to the instance of the object itself.

**Code Example - Classes and Objects:**

```python
class Dog:
    """A simple class representing a dog."""
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        """Initializes a new Dog object."""
        self.name = name  # Attribute
        self.breed = breed # Attribute

    def bark(self):
        """A method for the dog to bark."""
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

    def display_info(self):
        """Displays information about the dog."""
        return f"Name: {self.name}, Breed: {self.breed}"

# Create an object (instance) of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
your_dog = Dog("Lucy", "Labrador")

# Access attributes
print(f"My dog's name: {my_dog.name}")

# Call methods
print(my_dog.bark())
print(your_dog.display_info())
```
**Explanation:** The `Dog` class defines what a dog object has (`name`, `breed`) and what it can do (`bark`, `display_info`). `__init__` sets up the initial state of each dog. `my_dog` and `your_dog` are distinct objects created from the `Dog` class, each with its own `name` and `breed`.

*   **Inheritance:** A mechanism where a new class (child/derived/subclass) can be created from an existing class (parent/base/superclass), inheriting its attributes and methods. This promotes code reuse and models "is-a" relationships.
    *   **Types of Inheritance:**
        *   **Simple/Single:** One child class inherits from one parent class.
        *   **Hierarchical:** Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.
        *   **Multiple:** A child class inherits from multiple parent classes.
        *   **Multi-level:** A class inherits from another class, which itself inherited from a third class (A -> B -> C).
        *   **Hybrid:** A combination of two or more types of inheritance.

**Code Example - Inheritance:**

```python
class Animal: # Parent/Base class
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement abstract method")

class Cat(Animal): # Child/Derived class, inherits from Animal
    def __init__(self, name, color):
        super().__init__(name) # Call parent's constructor
        self.color = color

    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Meow!"

    def purr(self):
        return f"{self.name} purrs softly."

my_cat = Cat("Whiskers", "black")
print(my_cat.speak()) # Calls the Cat's speak method
print(my_cat.purr())
print(f"My cat's name: {my_cat.name}, color: {my_cat.color}")
```
**Explanation:** The `Cat` class inherits from `Animal`. `super().__init__(name)` calls the `Animal` class's constructor to initialize the `name` attribute. `Cat` then adds its own `color` attribute and overrides the `speak` method to provide a specific cat sound, also adding a `purr` method.
